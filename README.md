# React Hooks & Context Demo

Live URL: https://laszlo-lazuer.github.io/react-context-hooks/

## Quick demo based on a couple of readings.  This Demo covers:
* React Hooks
* React Context
* Proof of concept which demo's a nested component leveraging the state via a  `Provider`.


#### If you pull up the `React` developer tab you will see the hook managed state.
